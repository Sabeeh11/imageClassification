YOLO Image Classification with Google Colab
This repository provides a guide to training and evaluating a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for image classification using Google Colab and the Ultralytics library.

Setup
Mount Google Drive: Connect Google Drive to Colab to access your dataset and save results.
Install Dependencies: Install the Ultralytics library.
Training
Train the YOLO model using your dataset stored in Google Drive. The model will be trained for a specified number of epochs and results will be saved.

Evaluation
After training, evaluate the model's performance:

Plot Accuracy: Generate plots to visualize accuracy metrics.
Test the Model: Load the trained model and test it on sample images to obtain classification results.
Notes
Ensure your dataset is properly organized and accessible.
Modify paths and parameters according to your specific setup.
